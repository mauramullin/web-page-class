	<p>If you are looking for a good play to see in New York and exciting ghost encounters, come to the New Amsterdam Theatre.
	Come see <i>Aladdin</i> which is known to be haunted by a girl named Olive Thomas. You can see Olive's picture as you enter 
	the main entrance on 42nd Street.</p>
	<h3>The Ghost of Olive Thomas</h3>
	<p>When Olive had passed in the 1920's, workers at the theatre reportedly told others that they
	kept running into Olive backstage. However, she was dead. Workers at the theatre, now embrace Olive's ghost because she is playful,
	and never violent.</p>
